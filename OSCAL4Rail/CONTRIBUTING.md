## Types of Contributions

| Type | How |
|------|-----|
| New catalog | Extract a regulation and submit a PR |

| Tooling improvement | PR against `tools/` |
| Documentation | PR against `docs/` |
| New use case / example | PR against `docs/examples/` |

## Core Principle: Verbatim Only

**Never paraphrase regulation text.** Every `statement` in a control must be a verbatim quote from the source document. If the source text is unclear or ambiguous, add a `guidance` part with your interpretation — but keep the `statement` unchanged.

## Submitting a New Catalog

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch: `feat/catalog-<name>-<language>` (e.g. `feat/catalog-tsi-tat-en`)
3. Run the extraction pipeline or create the YAML manually
4. Validate: `python3 tools/validate.py catalogs/<your-catalog>.yaml`
5. Add source files to the PR description (or link to them)
6. Submit a PR with title: `feat(catalog): add <regulation> <language>`

### Required fields per control

```yaml
- id: <regulation-prefix>-<chapter>        # e.g. bs-ki-2.1
  title: "Rule title"
  parts:
    - name: statement
      prose: |
        «Verbatim quote from source»
  props:
    - name: source-chapter
      value: "2.1"
    - name: source-document
      value: "source-file.pdf"
```

## Submitting a Catalog Correction

1. Open an issue with:
   - Control ID
   - Current text
   - Correct text
   - Source: document name, page number, chapter
2. Or submit a PR directly with the fix

## Commit Message Convention

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat(catalog): add bs-ki FR catalog
fix(bs-ki): correct verbatim quote in control bs-ki-2.5
docs: add how-to for migrating existing governance
chore: update NIST schema to v1.1.3
```

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful. This is a technical project serving the public good. Disagreements about regulation interpretation should be resolved by reference to the source document and, if needed, by consulting the relevant standards body.
